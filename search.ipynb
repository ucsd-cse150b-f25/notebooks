We must begin by precisely defining **problems** and their **solutions**. We will look at several general-purpose search algorithms.\n",

    "* **Uninformed search algorithms**: Search algorithms which explore the search space without having any information about the problem other than its definition.\n",

    "        1. Breadth First Search\n",
    "        2. Depth First Search\n",
    "        3. Depth Limited Search\n",
